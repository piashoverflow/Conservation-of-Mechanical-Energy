## 🔬 Overview & Conceptual Motivation

Interactive computational mechanics simulator demonstrating mechanical energy conservation across free fall, vertical throw, and projectile motion.

Designed from **first-principles physics and numerical mechanics**, this simulation bridges textbook analytical theory and real-time computation. It enables students, researchers, and competitive engineering candidates to visualize dynamic force interactions, observe parametric trends, and verify conservation laws interactively.

## 📐 Mathematical Formulation & Physics Derivations

### Governing Dynamic Equations

In an isolated mechanical system subject exclusively to conservative gravitational forces:

$$\Delta E = \Delta K + \Delta U = 0 \implies K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$$

For arbitrary projectile motion:

$$E(t) = \frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y(t)^2) + m g y(t) = \frac{1}{2} m (v_0 \cos\theta)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m (v_0 \sin\theta - g t)^2 + m g (v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2)$$

Expanding and simplifying proves:

$$E(t) \equiv \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = \text{constant}, \quad \forall t \ge 0$$
